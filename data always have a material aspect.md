> Whereas computational friction expresses the struggle involved in

> concept of *data friction* expresses a more primitive form of
> resistance. Like computation, <span class="mark">data always have a

> numbers but also numerals, with dimensionality, weight, and texture.
> ‘Data friction’ refers to the costs in time, energy, and attention
> required simply to collect, check, store, move, receive, and access
> data. Whenever data travel—whether from one place on Earth to another,
> from one machine (or computer) to another, or from one medium
> (e.g. punch cards) to another (e.g. magnetic tape)—data friction
> impedes their movement. Since computation is one kind of operation on
> data, computational friction and data friction often interact.
